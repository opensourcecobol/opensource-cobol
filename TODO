OpenCOBOL TODO						-*- outline -*-

1 Pending requests

1.1 Handling of EBCDIC files

1.2 Listing file
(2004-02-13: BUG: "COPY REPLACING ..."  and  REQUEST for "mini-listing")

1.3 Partial expression in the EVALUATE statement
(2004-02-19: feature request:  EVALUATE: partial-expression)

1.4 READ ... PREVIOUS

1.5 many bugs reported recently

2 Other features to be implemented

2.2 SCREEN SECTION

COBOL 2002 has defined extended ACCEPT/DISPLAY.
We can do this eventually.

2.3 Embedded SQL

Frank Polscheit posted his implementation of SQL preprocessor.
(2004-02-17: SQL pre-processor for OPEN-COBOL)

Firebird (firebird.sourceforge.net) has a SQL preprocessor
for their database.

2.4 New backends for INDEXED files

 - Look at C-ISAM replacements

3 Improvement of compiler internals

3.1 Error checking

3.1.1 Type checking with each statement

Most statements do not check the type of thier parameters.
We should do it at the beginning of each cb_emit_* functions.

3.1.2 Strict error checking depending on the standard
Partially implemented

3.1.4 Use `error' token in the parser for better error recovery

4 Optimization

4.1 More inlining of run-time functions

Done with various binary operands

5 Debugging support

5.1 Data access method

We should generate all data hierarchy defined in a COBOL program
with all relevant information, including data names, picture clauses,
and source locations.  We should also define a debugging function
that receives a data name and displays its value using the generated
data hierarchy.  By calling the function from gdb, we can easily
access the COBOL data at debugging time.

6 Better user manual

Yes, we should
